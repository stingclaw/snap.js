# SnapJS

SnapJS is a simple jQuery plugin/extension that simplifies many aspects of JavaScript and jQuery. It is currently in Alpha 0.4, and its capabilities range from forms to new attributes to string manipulation.

### Using SnapJS

The full package can be downloaded [here](http://github.com/stingclaw/snap.js/zipball/master), and placed in your website's source code. However, SnapJS is a jQuery *extension*, which means you still need to include jQuery before it (see Troubleshooting for error handling).

SnapJS is by no means finished, so it is not hosted by a CDN yet.

### Documentation

The official SnapJS documentation is not available yet, but will be soon.

### Troubleshooting

If SnapJS does not seem to work, go through the following list:

1. Consider that SnapJS is in Alpha and has not been tested extensively.
2. Make sure your `<script>` tags are positioned correctly (jQuery first, then SnapJS, then your JavaScript)
3. Type `snap.exists` in your browser console
4. Read the documentation to see if you are using the commands correctly
5. Read the source code to see how it works
6. If nothing else works, file an issue on GitHub
